 $ cd intro-javascript-lab/
```

## Object Traversal

For this exercise, you will have to `console.log` different properties of the `garden` object.

### Settings note

If you don't like having to horizontally scroll to see the content of a very long line, enabling line wrapping settings will. To add the settings below to your VSCode settings, hit `⌘ ,` and then paste in the 2 lines below...

```JSON
    "editor.wordWrap": "on",
    "editor.wrappingIndent": "indent",
```

> In VSCode, Atom, and Sublime Text, you can use `⌘ ⇧ P` (command shift p) to search through all the commands available in the editor. For Atom and Sublime Users, you can find the appropriate settings in this manner. The setting might be labeled as soft wrap.
